This code review is just a simplistic example. In a real scenario, the review would be more thorough and may require further expertise in blockchain and solidity.

1. Executive Summary

The audited code is for a simple lottery game using the Ethereum-based smart contract. Critical findings such as vulnerable pseudo-random number generation, pot (jackpot) mechanism, and possible manipulation by the contract owner were discovered. The severity assessment is high due to vulnerabilities that could lead to asset manipulation or seizure. The code runs on Solidity.

2. Vulnerability Analysis

Vulnerability: Pseudo-Random Number Generation
Description: The random number generating function (random()) is vulnerable as it's deterministic and predictable. 
Impact: It could be exploited to predict the outcome.
Code Snippet: `function random(uint Max) constant private returns (uint256 result){}`
Remediation: Implement a secure random number generation method or use a trusted oracle for generating random numbers.
References: N/A

Vulnerability: Pot Distribution Mechanism
Description: The winning pot distribution condition is flawed and can be exploited by sending 1 ether deposit. 
Impact: Misuse of the mechanism for an unfair advantage.
Code Snippet: `if(  ( deposit > 1 ether ) && (deposit > players[Payout_id].payout) ){}`
Remediation: The condition should consider additional checks to secure the pot distribution logic.
References: N/A

Vulnerability: Privileges granted to the contract owner
Description: The contract owner can change ownership, collect all fees, and reduce fees, which potentially allows manipulation.
Impact: The contract owner can misuse the functions for their own advantage.
Code Snippet: `function ChangeOwnership(address _owner) onlyowner{} function CollectAllFees() onlyowner{} function GetAndReduceFeesByFraction(uint p) onlyowner{}`
Remediation: Limit the power of the contract owner or implement more decent governance mechanisms.

3. Best Practices and Considerations

The aforementioned vulnerabilities show that the code doesn't fully adhere to secure and trustless smart contract practices. To optimize the code, consider refactoring to reduce complexity. Moreover, implementing clear documentation/commenting through the code, would enhance code readability and maintenance.

4. Testing and Audit Methodology

The methodology employed for this audit was manual auditing of the code. An automated smart contract auditing tool should be considered for in-depth code and security analysis.
